This is the first project that I've ever done!<br>
I did a small project for freecodecamp.org, but this is my first start-to-finish project.
Assignment is to build the Google.com homepage.  (Just the simple version with the search box)
Skills that I'll be demonstrating upon completion:
    1) Creation of files and folders
    2) Using Git/ Github to properly track changes, including using "commits" properly.
    3) Proper use of html to build the main structure of the site
    4) Propert use of css to style the site, including moving of elements around the screen, and use of responsive design elements.
    5) How to build a basic form
